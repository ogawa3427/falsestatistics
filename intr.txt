My view of history has sifted to boaderless one from domestic one. Before this class, there should be a gap bettween subjests, Japnese history and Internatioanal history. I actully had no valid belief to devide contents. The gap was just a unclear stereotype. I refound it as what has happend about there regardless where people were. Futher more, just focusing on domestic materials may ruin the effect of learning history. Two exapmles to make me realize so is to be explaind in this essey.
The first example is the US's plabaganda against Japan during the asia and pasiphic war. Refering plobaganda such as "Tokio Kid Say" and any publishments, we can learn how American civilians had regerded Japaneses. If we had used only domestic historic materials to study, we should have undertood mistakingly even only the Japanese perspective of the war. However, by integrating international materials, we gain a more comprehensive understanding of the sentiments and perceptions in that situation. For instance, "Tokio Kid Say" and a slogan,"鬼畜米英" portraited their hostile contries asif non-human monsters lived there in negative ways. The posters and words provided racial prejudices of unknowun image of the eneemies in both the US and Japan. If we had not studied with both materials, we should find our plobagandas as a unique heavy fault. This misunderstanding is exactory a today's new prejudice.
