My view of history has sifted to boaderless one from domestic one. Before this class, there should be a gap bettween subjests, Japnese history and Internatioanal history. I actully had no valid belief to devide contents. The gap was just a unclear stereotype. I refound it as what has happend about there regardless where people were. [] exapmles to make me realize so is to be explaind in this essey.
